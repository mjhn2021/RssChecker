      <title>MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF: Holly Bartlett</title>
      <description>On a cold day in March 2010, workers discovered a woman lying unconscious under the MacKay Bridge in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada - barely breathing and clinging to life. It was 31-year-old Holly Bartlett. Police say she walked almost a quarter of a mile from the front door of her condo building, where she crawled through a hole in a barbed wire fence, climbed a 20ft concrete cable abutment, and fell to the frozen ground below. But that theory makes no sense to Holly’s friends and family, who spend the next ten years trying to understand what happened to Holly Bartlett.

      <title>SERIAL KILLER: The Butcher Baker of Alaska</title>
      <description>Robert Hansen owned and operated a successful bakery in Anchorage, Alaska in the 1970s and 80s, selling donuts and danishes to everyone in town. He was a well-known and well-respected member of the business community, living in a nice home in the suburbs with his wife and two children. In his spare time, he liked to fly his plane to the remote area around the Knik River and hunt for wolves and caribou and other large game. But sometimes the wild animals just weren’t enough. He needed something else to hunt, to chase along the river flats, to stalk and kill.

      <description>For over 20 years young college-aged men have been going missing, only to turn up dead in local waterways. Police think these cases are tragic accidents, but a small group of investigators have long believed there’s something else at work…something much more sinister that all leads back to one huge question. Are the Smiley Face Killers real?

      <title>MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF: Rey Rivera</title>
      <description>In 2006 Rey Rivera was found dead at the Belvedere Hotel in Baltimore. Did he die by suicide, or was something more sinister at play?
Following the release of this episode, representatives of Porter Stansberry contacted Crime Junkie to inform us of information regarding Rey Rivera’s case that had not yet been made public, and we want to alert our listeners to that information for the sake of being exhaustive. Not only did Porter Stansberry offer a reward to find Rey, he also hired a private detective to lead the search for Rey. Although previously reported accounts suggested that Porter did not cooperate with police, this appears not to have been correct. Porter did urge all of his employees and even all of his company’s clients to contact the police with any information about Rey’s whereabouts. After Rey’s body was found, Porter never issued a gag order telling employees not to help the police. Porter in fact fully cooperated with the Police after Rey’s body was found, including being interviewed by the lead detective in the case on June 23rd 2006.

      <title>CAPTURED: Lloyd Lee Welch</title>
      <description>During spring break of 1975, Sheila &amp; Kate Lyon went missing from a shopping center near their home and for almost 40 years no one knew what happened to them. Over the years horrible men would come into focus as suspects. Men who took the lives of 10-year-old Amanda Ray, 5-year-old Neely Smith, and 15-year-old Kathy Beatty. But it wasn't until a cold case investigator came across a single old report from 1975 (a report that had been there all along) that the case would finally be solved and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Lyon would finally have answers about what happened to their daughters.

      <title>INFAMOUS: Alice Crimmins</title>
      <description>Long before Casey Anthony, there was another mother America loved to hate... Alice Crimmins. When her children went missing from their room one summer night, the police and the press were quick to point the finger at the "sex-crazed" mother. At the start of the women's lib movement, Alice stood for everything that threatened the status quo of how a wife and mother should behave. But over 50 years later we can re-examine the case and her multiple trials to see if there really was a case against Alice or if she was the victim of a witch hunt.

      <description>In August of 1976, the bodies of a young man and woman were found in rural Sumter County, South Carolina. Police would infer a lot from their belongings and the state of their bodies, but more than four decades later, their identities - as well as the identity of their killer - remain a mystery... BUT the Crime Junkies have a chance to change that.

      <title>UPDATE: Angela Mischelle Lawless (Interview with Josh Kezer)</title>
      <description>UPDATE: Josh Kezer, the man who was wrongfully convicted of Angela's murder and then later declared actually innocent, reached out to us to discuss the case. If you are familiar with the case details you can skip to 52:20 just to hear his interview.

*******
In November 1992, Mischelle Lawless was found by passersby deceased in her car with the headlights on and vehicle still running. Police have spent decades trying to piece together what happened to Mischelle that night. Who would she have pulled over for? Where was she headed? And even though a man served 16 years for her murder the current sherriff is convinced they still have not captured Mishelle's killer and it could all be tied back to the man... or men... who initially found her car.

      <description>In the early 90's, Austin, TX was turned upside down when four young girls were sexually assaulted, murdered, then set on fire inside an ICBY store. Four men were accused of the crime, but there have always been questions around their guilt. Those questions have only been amplified in recent years as new DNA technology as revealed an unknown perpetrator's DNA at the scene.

But with a staged crime scene, a timeline that doesn't add up, and three people keeping secrets we may never get to the bottom of what happened in the Swann Street house on August 2, 2006.

      <title>WANTED: Bradford Bishop // Yaser Said</title>
      <description>This week, we have two stories for you of men who are wanted for killing their families. 
Our first story is about a man named Bradford Bishop, a man who, after not receiving a promotion at work, went home, and methodically killed his entire family. Officials believe he then fled the country and has been living out his days in Europe. 
Our second story is about a man named Yaser Said who is still on the FBI's 10 most wanted list for murdering his two daughters in the back of his cab. His daughter died while on the phone with 911 trying to get help, but they couldn't get to her in time. The FBI believe Yasser is now living in NYC and working as a cab driver.

      <title>MISSING: Asha Degree</title>
      <description>In February of 2000, a 9-year-old girl named Asha Degree packed her book bag and tucked it away, waiting for the right time to sneak out of her North Carolina home. To this day, no one knows why she left, or why she was walking along Highway 18 alone around 4 in the morning. And the case would only get more confusing as her belongings start to pop up along that same highway, spaced out over 26 miles, and 18 months.

      <title>CONSPIRACY: Women in the U.S. Military </title>
      <description>In 2010, statistics came out that 120 female U.S. soldiers stationed in Iraq had died. Half of those deaths were reported to be non-combat related. 30 those non-combat related deaths were ruled suicides, but there is evidence to suggest many of them may have actually been murders.
In this episode, we dive into the case of LaVena Johnson and other women of the U.S. military who died very suspicious deaths during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

      <title>MISSING: Maura Murray (Part 2)</title>
      <description>This week we re-examine everything we thought we knew about Maura and her disappearance. Lying, stealing, cheating... all of this led Maura to leave her dorm room that February 9th. But the more we learn about Maura and her life the more questions we have about why she would have gone to New Hampshire and if she really traveling alone?

      <title>MISSING: Maura Murray (Part 1)</title>
      <description>In 2004 a 21-year-old UMass student, Maura Murray, sends a message to her professors saying there has been a death in her family and she will be out for the next week. But that's a lie. No one can explain why Maura did this or her strange actions to follow but just hours after sending that email, Maura ends up crashing her car on a rural road in Haverhill, NH. She is seen and talked to by locals but in a 7-minute window, when everyone seems to look away, Maura vanishes. In this first episode, I will tell you what we all thought we knew about Maura and her disappearance early on in the investigation.

      <title>SERIAL KILLER: Bible John</title>
      <description>In the late 1960s, three women were murdered after attending the same nightclub. But aside from their location, all three women had something very specific in common. Was this thing they had in common the reason they were killed or was their killer, a man now known as Bible John, after them because they were frequenting a nightclub known for hookups and infidelity? It is now decades later and police are still looking for a red-haired man last seen with all three women.

      <title>MURDERED: Angela Mischelle Lawless</title>
      <description>In November 1992, Mischelle Lawless was found by passersbys deceased in her car with the headlights on and the vehicle still running. Police have spent decades trying to piece together what happened to Mischelle that night. Who would she have pulled over for? Where was she headed? And even though a man served 16 years for her murder the current sheriff is convinced they still have not captured Mishelle's killer and it could all be tied back to the man... or men... who initially found her car.

      <description>Since 1993, women in Juarez, Mexico have been dying violent deaths. Is this the work of one killer or multiple? Also, why did the state police work so hard to convince the public that it was the work of a man who was incarcerated, while many of the murders were still being committed?

      <title>SERIAL KILLER: The Claremont Killer</title>
      <description>Since 1996, people in Claremont had been looking over their shoulders when they go out for a night on the town. Over the span of a few years, three girls were taken from the same place in nearly identical fashions. Many years later, those crimes would be connected to other attacks dating back to 1988. And somehow, in 2016, a man was arrested for these crimes... But we still don't know exactly how police got his name.

      <title>MISSING: Sage Smith</title>
      <description>On November 20, 2012, Sage Smith left her home at 5:30 for a date. She was seen alone at 6:30 talking to someone on the phone and then possibly sighted one more time at 7:00 at a cafe, again alone. Her father and friends were advocates and attempted to investigate her disappearance on their own, but ended up in the same place where the police ended up. At a dead end. No one has seen her since and police are still looking to speak with the man she last communicated with that day.

      <title>SERIAL KILLER: The Green River Killer</title>
      <description>Through the 80's &amp; 90's, women in the state of Washington were turning up dead. First, along the Green River, then in other clusters throughout the state and even into Portland, Oregon. Not only had these women been murdered but their killer would re-visit their corpses and sexually assault them multiple times until their corpses were fully decomposed and consumed by maggots. A man named Gary Ridgeway had been pointed out by a number of witnesses as being the Green River Killer but police were unable to make an arrest until DNA connected him to four crime scenes in 2001 – two decades and at least 49 victims later.

      <title>MISSING: Misty Copsey</title>
      <description>In September of 1992, a young teenager named Misty Copsey went missing after visiting the local fair in Puyallup, Washington with her best friend. Almost 26 years have passed and all we have are a handful of suspicious suspects and a pair of jeans found at a site that could be linked to a serial killer. Plus, a rogue private citizen, whose efforts to try to solve the case have become an obsession, that might actually be distracting from the real investigation.

      <itunes:summary>In September of 1992, a young teenager named Misty Copsey went missing after visiting the local fair in Puyallup, Washington with her best friend. Almost 26 years have passed and all we have are a handful of suspicious suspects and a pair of jeans found at a site that could be linked to a serial killer. Plus, a rogue private citizen, whose efforts to try to solve the case have become an obsession, that might actually be distracting from the real investigation.

      <title>CAPTURED: Ashley Freeman and Lauria Bible's Killer</title>
      <description> In April of 2018, we were all talking about the capture of the Gold State Killer but did you know another long-time cold case was solved that same week? On December 29, 1999, best friends Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman were having a sleepover at Ashley's house. Sometime in the early morning hours of December 30th, Ashley's parents were murdered and their home set on fire. The two girls were never seen again. For years, theories surrounded this case. Did Someone take the girls? Were the girls responsible for one or more murders and then ran off to start new lives? Well in 2018 we finally got answers, though, as of this recording their remains have still not been found.

When Kenia's stepdad finds an eerie text message from a stranger on her phone, it leads him and police right to her killer.

      <title>ADNAN: What Serial Didn't Tell You</title>
      <description>Hundreds of millions of people tuned into Serial season one back in 2014. Sarah Koenig told us all about the story of 18-year-old high school senior Hae Min Lee who disappeared on January 13th, 1999. Hae's body was later found in Leakin Park, and not too long after the discovery of her body, police zeroed in on their prime suspect: Adnan Syed. Sarah took us all through 12 episodes of "Did he or didn't he?" and many of us ended the season with more questions than answers. But did you know that Serial was just the beginning and there was so much that Sarah never covered? If you listened to Serial season one, you must listen to this single episode that sums up the top four points Serial didn't tell you, but you need to know before you decide whether or not you think Adnan is guilty. We won't be re-covering the Serial story - we jump in assuming you already know it. So, if you haven't listened yet, check out the first season of Serial.

      <title>WANTED: Monster in Fort Wayne, Indiana </title>
      <description>Thirty years ago this week, a little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was abducted, sexually assaulted, murdered and now, forgotten by everyone. It is one of the most horrific crimes we've ever researched, and yet when we ask people if they know about April Tinsley, we only get blank stares. This man, who police believed was local, not only committed the crime, but taunted police and the community for 16 years after. He could still be walking among us - You could very well know him.

      <title>MISSING: Kiplyn Davis</title>
      <description>In 1995, one of our listeners from Kentucky was high school pen pals with a girl named Kiplyn Davis from Spanish Fork, Utah, when one day the Spanish Fork Police called looking for answers. Kiplyn had gone missing. Kiplyn's story takes over 16 years to unfold and even though a few young men have been accused of and pled guilty to murder, no one has ever found Kiplyn or her remains.

      <title>MURDERED: The Longo Family</title>
      <description>What makes a seemingly normal family man snap, murder his entire family, and assume a new identity in Mexico? Christian Longo was a husband, and father of three kids, who moved his family to Oregon to escape legal and money trouble he had accrued back in Michigan. But the new start didn't take away the pressure of supporting a family on a part-time, minimum wage income. One December day, Christian's family is found in the most horrific ways and Christian is nowhere to be found. The prosecution and the public seem pretty clear on what took place the day the Longo family died, but Christian's surprise story after he goes to trial is just his final way of disgracing his family.

      <title>CONSPIRACY: Bardstown, Kentucky</title>
      <description>A 35-year-old woman named Crystal Rogers went missing from Bardstown, KY back in 2015\. Her car was found on the side of a busy parkway with a flat tire, keys, wallet, and phone still inside. Just 16 months later, while searching for answers, Crystal's father is murdered in cold blood. Now, people are wondering if these two crimes are connected to a bigger conspiracy that started with the murder of a police officer in 2013\. Could all of these seemingly different attacks be related?

      <title>MURDERED: Amy Weidner</title>
      <description>A teenage mother stays home from school one day with her daughter because she isn't feeling well. Just a few hours after her family leaves the house she is brutally attacked. Surely it had to be someone she knew. Did they know she would be home that day? It is a case that goes cold for nearly two decades before someone unexpected comes in and cracks the case wide open.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today we read the epic story of how David defeats Goliath, a giant Philistine warrior. Fr. Mike points out that David&#39;s heroic courage in this battle came from David&#39;s faithfulness to God and to the small tasks entrusted to him as a shepherd. We learn that when we are faithful and courageous in small matters, we can face the giants in our bigger battles. Today&#39;s readings are 1 Samuel 17 and Psalm 12.</p>
